AiCore Project 3 - Football Match Outcome Prediction

## Milestone 1 - EDA and Data Cleaning
In this project, we start with three data sources namely Result CSV for several football league, Matches information csv and Team information csv. And in this milestone, I will try to experience the EDA and clean up procedures.

### Data source files
####Football.zip
The file includes all result information for several leagues. After unzipping the file, it contains different league folders with different season results in different csv. The file naming convention is Results_<Season>_<League>.csv. For example, for 2021 result of Premier League result is in /Results/premier_league/Results_2021_premier_league.csv. In the csv file, it contains fields as follows: Home_Team, Away_Team, Result, Link, Season, Round and League

#####Combine the data into pandas
To better explore the data, I will create a python class for accessing the data. In the class, I will combine all csv into a pandas dataframe as follows:
```python

```
For details of the class, please see <FILE>.

####Match_Info.csv
Link,Date_New,Referee,Home_Yellow,Home_Red,Away_Yellow,Away_Red

####Team_Info.csv
Team,City,Country,Stadium,Capacity,Pitch
